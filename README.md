Configs (#includes, #defines, .vimrc, makefile, a testing shell script, a wrapper for overriding the stack size limit)
A Java skeleton using BigInteger, plus sorting and graph traversal (the language of choice at Warsaw is C++, but it’s common knowledge that if there’s a problem that requires bignums and not much more, it might be easier to use Java, rather than to copy the bignum code in C++; so there’s a skeleton Java code to copy language structures from).
Graph algos: LCA, 2-SAT, strongly-connected and two-connected components, bridges. K-shortest-paths. Finding a negative cycle. Maintaining cographs.
Flow algos: flow for unit edges, max-matching in a bipartite graph, Hungarian, Dinic, min-cost-max-flow, stable marriages.
Constant time Geometry: Angle compare. Point distance from line. Point in rectangle. Point in segment. Line cross, Circle cross line, Circle cross, Circle through three points.
Other geometry: Convex hull. Polygon area. Point in Polygon. Point in convex polygon. Polygon semiplane intersection. Nearest points. Max square. Max rectangle.
3D geometry: Basic definitions, convex hull.
Combinatorics: Permutations in antylex order. Permutations via minimum transpositions. K-element-subsets. All divisions of a set.
Number theory: Binoms, GCD, exponent modulo, reverse module, primality test.
Bignums: two definitions (one handles negative numbers). Primality test.
Data structures: Find-union. Range tree. 2D range tree. Cover tree. Some of these have dynamic variants as well.
Text algo: Suffix tree. Longest common substring. KMP. Manacher. Cyclic equivalence.
Linear algebra: Determinant mod N. Gauss elimination mod P.
Various: Simplex. FFT. Matrix mult. N queens. Inversions in a permutation.
